# Ionic E2E Example

This example app demonstrates how to build web and native end-to-end (E2E) tests with Ionic and Cordova or Capacitor. This example uses popular tools like [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io) and [Appium](https://appium.io) to enable cross-platform tests for iOS, Android, Web, and more.

Additionally, this example comes with some helpers that make it easier to write tests against Ionic or hybrid apps in general.

## About the Testing Stack

We've chosen WebdriverIO as the primary test runner and API for test authoring. WebdriverIO is the leading Node.js-based test automation framework and supports a wide variety of tools that support the WebDriver protocol.

WebdriverIO orchestrates tools like Appium and Chromedriver to actually run tests on target devices or a web browser.

One of the benefits of this stack compared to popular tools like [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io) is that it can test your actual native app, the same app that you'll ship to end users, but with a similar test authoring API.
